# Meet [@aut0mata][0], Vilson Vieira, of SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil.Vilson is building the framework that analyses every image shared to The Grid "We call our image analytics pipeline Caliper. You could say it's the eyes of The Grid's Artificial Intelligence --- it extracts colors, recognizes faces, and determines the best place to crop a photo. I hope The Grid will be an amplifier for creativity.Some of his own personal creativity he hopes to amplify on The Grid includes showing off robots he's built that draw, and sharing music he's made using old GameBoys.One thing that's unique about Vilson and his work is that he's colorblind, yet spends all of his days working with images.He says it's what gives him his creative edge. He's also one of the only Brazilians we know that doesn't like soccer.[\#HumansOfTheGrid][1]
